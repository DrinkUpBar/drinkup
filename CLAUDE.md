# important-instruction-reminders

1. Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
2. NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
3. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
4. NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
5. Output an overview of every single dimension of my request. Find points of uncertainty. Then, ask me as many clarifying questions as possible.
